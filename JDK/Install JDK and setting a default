How to install JDK on Ubuntu!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two Options:
--------------------------------------
First Option:

 1 .From the Oracle Website Download the Linux Compressed Archive Product (this ending with .tar.gz)
 
 2. new Folder where you want to save the JDK. (e.g. sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm)
 
 3. extract the files out of the downloaded .tar.gz. folder. The extracted folder is then probably in your "Downloads". tar -zxvf "name".tar.gz
 
 4. then move this extracted folder to your "new Folder from point 2" sudo mv "name" "where"
 
 5. Then you have to write the following in the terminal:
 	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java "Path where you saved the folder but it has to end with /bin/java + number for priority
 	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac "Path where you saved the folder but it has to end with /bin/javac  + number for priority
 	
 6. Check with java --version and javac --version if the installation was successfull
 
 7. sudo update-alternatives --config java (or javac) let change the default java or javac version
 
 8. when you have decided your default version you should write in the terminal 
 	sudo gedit /etc/environment
    it will open the text editor. Below the Path="/usr/local......./local/games" you have to write JAVA_HOME="Path ..../jdk-version" The path is always the one of the default version. So you have to change it when you change the default.
 
 9. to execute the .txt you have to write: source /etc/environment
 
--------------------------------------
Second Option:

 1 .From the Oracle Website Download the Linux Debian Package Product (this ending with .deb)
 
 2. depackage the file out of the downloaded .deb folder. The extracted folder is then probably in your "Downloads". sudo dpkg -i "name".deb
 
 3. then your folder is already moved to /usr/lib/jvm/
 
 4. Then you have to write the following in the terminal:
 	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/java-version/bin/java + number for priority
 	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/java-version/bin/javac   + number for priority
 	
 5. Check with java --version and javac --version if the installation was successfull
 
 6. sudo update-alternatives --config java (or javac) let change the default java or javac version
 
 7. when you have decided your default version you should write in the terminal 
 	sudo gedit /etc/environment
    it will open the text editor. Below the Path="/usr/local......./local/games" you have to write JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-version" The path is always the one of the default version. So you have to change it when you change the default.
    
 8. to execute the .txt you have to write: source /etc/environment
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
to open a secure file (that can only open the owner or the root) you have to write: sudo gedit "Path"
 
if you want to install more than just one version of JDK you have to follow the steps above again! The sudo update-alternatives --install command will not overwrite the last installed version!
