# HowTo
Hello this repository is about things that are not that easy and should help everybody who wants to begin in software development. I know that it is not easy to handle the many changes, forums and documentations of the whole SW-Development and that is the reason I created this repo. 

You can create every Folder you would like but the files should be named under the following rules. I created a folder structure but you do not have to obey these structure. But if you make a pull request I will include the files in the folder structure I made. 


## How to name the Files of this repo:

### for programming languages:
Please describe the problem that you have/had in your texteditor or in .md format at the beginning. The name of the file should be the problem itself! The following format is the one which should be used:
  **xxxxxxx_language.txt (or .md)** eg. : problem_javascript.txt
  
### for OS, GIT, GITHUB, IDEs,......
Again please use the .txt or .md format and describe your problem at the beginning of your file. In these above cases you should use the following format:
 - **xxxxxxx_"OS_NAME".txt(or .md)**
 - **xxxxxxx_"GIT".txt(or .md)**
 - **xxxxxxx_"GITHUB".txt(or .md)**
 - **xxxxxxx_"IDE".txt(or .md)**
 - **xxxxxxx_"yyyyyyyyy".txt(or .md)**

In any case you can write me and ask for clarification!


### General "things"
Every topic which is not about a particular topic or problem should be considered as a "General thing". For example this could be the beginning of git or the basic commands of the documentation. But again "In any case you can write me and ask for clarification!" 

## "General"
The folder General is for everything which is unclear to name or to include in a folder! When you make a pull request I will include and name it correctly!


##
I am looking forward to many problem-solving files and much fun to learn something about SW-Development :)
