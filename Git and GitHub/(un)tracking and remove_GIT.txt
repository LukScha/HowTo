remove files from local and repo: git rm "File"

remove folder from local and repo: git rm -r "Folder"

if you want to remove a file just from the repo you have to
	git rm --cached "File" 
and then you have to use 
	git add -u for your commits. 
	
The same but for folder: 	git rm -r --cached FOLDERNAME/
				
If you use git add . the "removed" file or folder is back on your index. 
If it is not on the index anymore other contriubters doesnt have access to the file!!! 
If you want that your collegues have access to the file than you can do instead:

	git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file
	to undo this: git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file
	
for folderds:
	go into the folder you want to assume is unchanged
		ls | xargs -l git update-index --assume-unchanged
		to undo: ls | xargs -l git update-index --no-assume-unchanged
