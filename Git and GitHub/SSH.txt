Why do I need a SSH key?

You can not have access to a private oder secured repository without a "Acces Token -HTTPS" or a "SSH-Key". A SSH key is only valuable on a single System. So if you want access
with two Computers you need two SSH-Keys! 
How to create a SSH key on Linux and how to implement it in GIT:

There are different keys this tutorial describes the type ED25519:

1.  check if there is already a SSH-Key on your Computer: ls -al ~/.ssh
    you should have a SSH-key in following file-type: id_dsa.pub, id_ecdsa.pub, id_ed25519.pub, id_rsa.pub
2.  if not create one: ssh-keygen -ed25519 -C "the email which is connected with your GIT account"
    then you should just press enter on the displayed default place where the .pub file will be saved
    then you have to use a passphrase (=password)
3. In the saved .pub file you find your SSH-key you have to copy it (with the email!!) and use it as a SSH Key in your GitHUB/LAB account
4.
